# [721. Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)

Given a list of `accounts` where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are **emails** representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails **in sorted order**. The accounts themselves can be returned in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]
```

1. 把每个email当作一个node，在同一个array中的email就连在一起（可以把所有email都和第一个email连线）

   ![fig](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/Figures/721/721A.png)

2. 对全部array都执行一遍，就会发现两个拥有相同email的array的graph会被连在一起

3. 然后再对每个array中的第一个email执行dfs，并把这第一个email放入visited，会遍历所有与第一个email连在一起的email，此时可以把连在一起的email放入result

4. 对于有的array中已经visited的第一个email，就跳过，因为这个array和其他array连在一起，已经被visited并且放入了result了

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts) {
        Map<String, List<String>> adj = new HashMap<>();

        for (List<String> account: accounts) {
            String email1 = account.get(1);
            for (int i = 2; i < account.size(); i++) {
                String curEmail = account.get(i);
                adj.putIfAbsent(email1, new ArrayList<>());
                adj.putIfAbsent(curEmail, new ArrayList<>());
                adj.get(email1).add(curEmail);
                adj.get(curEmail).add(email1);
            }
        }

        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (List<String> account : accounts) {
            String email1 = account.get(1);
            if (visited.contains(email1)) continue;

            ArrayList<String> mergedEmails = new ArrayList<>();
            dfs(email1, adj, mergedEmails, visited);
            if (mergedEmails.size() > 1) Collections.sort(mergedEmails);
            mergedEmails.add(0, account.get(0));
            result.add(mergedEmails);
        }

        return result;
    }

    private void dfs(String email, Map<String, List<String>> adj, List<String> mergedEmails, Set<String> visited) {
        if (visited.contains(email)) return;

        mergedEmails.add(email);
        visited.add(email);
        if (adj.get(email) != null) {
            for (String nextEmail : adj.get(email)) {
                dfs(nextEmail, adj, mergedEmails, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
